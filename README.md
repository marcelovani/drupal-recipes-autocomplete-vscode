# Drupal Recipes Autocomplete: VS Code Extension
VS Code extension that provides autocomplete for Drupal Recipes

At this point, this is only a POC on the top of the Drupal Extension, see https://github.com/kaermorchen/vscode-drupal/compare/master...marcelovani:vscode-drupal:drupal-recipes-autocomplete?expand=1

The plan is to move the code here and make it a standalone extension, this will speed up the development process.
Once the code is stable, we can discuss the possibiity to merge it with the Drupal Extension.

## TODO
- Move the code to this repo as a standalone extension
- List the extension in the Marketplace https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/
- List the extension as NPM package in https://www.npmjs.com/
- Use schemas to provide autocomplete items
